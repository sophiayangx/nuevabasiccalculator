# Basic Calculator
This app demonstrates addition and subtraction of two numbers provided by the user.  It is meant to be easy to understand and to serve as a staring point for a more advanced calculator.
### Ideas of Things To Improve!
- Add operations like multiplication, division, exponents, etc.
- Style the result:
  - Red for negative results
  - Green for positive results
  - Blank when result = 0
- Ability to handle floats/decimal numbers
  - Bonus points to for ability to toggle between integer vs. floating number operations.
- Add a "clear" button to clear each TextInput
  - Bonus points to move this combined TextInput and Clear button into a new "ClearableTextInput" Component in a new file.
- Add some styling to designate the currently selected operator.  So if the current operation is subtraction, the "-" sign would be a different color or have a box around it.
  - Again, bonus points to move the operator buttons and this new functionality to a new "Operator" Component in a new file.
